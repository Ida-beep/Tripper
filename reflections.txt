----In general----
- npm install parse



----Component Manifesto----
- All boxes that have the same structure should comply with given rules

- Case Conventions
    - Database
        - Entities/Tables/Class: First letter capital, e.g. FamilyMember
        - Attributes: camelCase



----Outstanding Issues----

- getCurrentExcursion() in ShoppingAPI is only returning a promise, but not the excursionID.
    Would love some help here. -Ingrid

- AddFamily Popup doesn't work onSubmit..

- EditExcursion might be currently adding new excursion instead of editing

- Unable to deselect items in table scaffolds

- updateExursion working, but is a little glitchy due to dates.. 
    might need to fix later.

- Select in tableScaffold acting funky 
    - Sometimes has to select twice the first time until item is added to array
    - Want item to be highlighted when it is selected

- PreviousDutiesPopup: 
    - Want to use arrow button to open excursion duties, but right now it creates an infinite loop.


----Discussions----
- AddFamily: Where should the state be? Where is it most logical?
- Shopping list: remove popup and make it a field above the list?
- Why is GuestDutyCard called XGuestDutyCard inside its component?
- What is the difference in fetchFamilyMembersFromDB and fetchGuestsFromDB?
    Same with getDuties and fetchDutiesFromDB + getContactMember
