Outstanding Issues
- FetchContactMember in Contact Person Card is being called 40 times when rendering.
    I have tried making it an async function, but did not do anything. Any help here? -Ingrid

- getCurrentExcursion() in ShoppingAPI is only returning a promise, but not the excursionID.
    Would love some help here. -Ingrid

- TableScaffold in ShoppingListCard won't render as it tries to render before it has been
    able to fetch the data. -Ingrid
