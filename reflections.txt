----In general----
- npm install parse



----Component Manifesto----
- All boxes that have the same structure should comply with given rules



-----Case Conventions----
- Database
    - Entities/Tables/Class: First letter capital, e.g. FamilyMember
    - Attributes: camelCase



----Outstanding Issues----

- getCurrentExcursion() in ShoppingAPI is only returning a promise, but not the excursionID.
    Would love some help here. -Ingrid

- TableScaffold in ShoppingListCard won't render as it tries to render before it has been
    able to fetch the data. -Ingrid

- AddFamily Popup doesn't work onSubmit..

- EditExcursion might be currently adding new excursion instead of editing


----Discussions----
- AddFamily: Where should the state be? Where is it most logical?
- Shopping list: remove popup and make it a field above the list?
- Why is GuestDutyCard called XGuestDutyCard inside its component?
- What is the difference in fetchFamilyMembersFromDB and fetchGuestsFromDB?
    Same with getDuties and fetchDutiesFromDB + getContactMember
